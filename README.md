* Overview
* This repository provides an in-depth analysis of movie ratings from critics and audiences. The dataset, Movie-Rating.csv, includes comprehensive information on films, such as genre, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, audience reviews, budget, and release year.

* Features
  ### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Contains procedures for cleaning and transforming the dataset, including data type conversions and column renaming.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts preliminary analysis to gain insights into data distributions and relationships.
### Advanced Visualization: 
Employs Seaborn and Matplotlib to produce detailed visualizations:
Joint Plots: Examine the relationship between critic and audience ratings.
Distribution Plots: Analyze the distribution of ratings.
Histograms and KDE Plots: Explore budget distributions across different genres.
Facet Grids: Perform multi-dimensional analysis to investigate how ratings and budgets vary across genres and years.
Box Plots and Violin Plots: Visualize rating distributions by genre and year.
### Tools and Libraries
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For generating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: For executing the analysis and visualizations interactively.
Key Highlights
Data Analysis: Includes initial data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
